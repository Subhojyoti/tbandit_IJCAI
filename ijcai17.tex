\title{Thresholding Bandits with Augmented UCB}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose the  Augmented-UCB (AugUCB) algorithm for the thresholding bandit problem, which is an instance of the combinatorial fixed-budget pure-exploration stochastic multi-armed bandit setup. Our algorithm is 
%is an anytime arm elimination variance-aware algorithm, and is the first of its kind which employs arm elimination 
based on arm elimination, employing both the mean and variance estimates.  
Theoretically, our algorithm provides a weaker guarantee (in terms of an upper bound on the expected loss) than APT \cite{locatelli2016optimal} and CSAR \cite{chen2014combinatorial}.
However, through simulation experiments we establish that our algorithm, being variance-aware, performs  better than APT and CSAR algorithms, particularly when a large number of arms are involved. 

%the latter ones since it is a variance-aware algorithm. In the considered test cases comprising large number of arms, our algorithm has consistently performed much better than the state-of-the art APT and CSAR algorithms.
