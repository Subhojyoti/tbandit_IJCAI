From a theoretical viewpoint we conclude the expected loss AugUCB is more than UCBEV (which has access to problem complexity). From the numerical experiments on settings with large number of arms with different mean and variance, we observed that AugUCB outperforms all the non-variance aware algorithms. It would be interesting future research to come up with an anytime version of AugUCB algorithm. This is also the first paper to apply elimination by variance estimation in the TBP problem by modifying UCB-Improved and CCB algrithms.
