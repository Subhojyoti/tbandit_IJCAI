We proposed the AugUCB algorithm for the thresholding bandit problem. A key feature of our algorithm is that it employs both mean and variance estimates for arm elimination. Hence, ours is the first variance-aware algorithm for the specific TBP that we have considered. Theoretically, we obtain an upper bound on the loss incurred by AugUCB. Although UCBEV provides a better guarantee, it is important to emphasize that UCBEV has access to the problem complexity (and is hence not realistic in practice). This is in contrast to our AugUCB, whose implementation does not require such complexity inputs. 
Finally, through extensive simulation experiments we have validated the performance of AugUCB.

%From a theoretical viewpoint we conclude the expected loss AugUCB is more than UCBEV (which has access to problem complexity). From the numerical experiments on settings with large number of arms with different mean and variance, we observed that AugUCB outperforms all the non-variance aware algorithms.

% It would be interesting future research to come up with an anytime version of AugUCB algorithm. This is also the first paper to apply elimination by variance estimation in the TBP problem by modifying UCB-Improved and CCB algorithms.
