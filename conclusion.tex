From a theoretical viewpoint, we conclude that considering only arm elimination by mean estimation, the expected loss AugUCB is more than APT and CSAR while considering arm elimination by both mean and variance estimation we see that the expected loss of AugUCB is more than only UCBEV (which has access to problem complexity). From the numerical experiments on settings with large number of arms with different mean and variance, we observed that AugUCB outperforms all the non-variance aware algorithms. It would be interesting future research to come up with an anytime version of AugUCB algorithm. This is also the first paper to apply elimination by variance estimation in the TBP problem by modifying UCB-Improved and CCB algrithms.
