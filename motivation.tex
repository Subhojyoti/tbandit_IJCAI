%The above TBP formulation has several applications, for instance, from areas ranging from anomaly detection and classification (see  \citet{locatelli2016optimal}) to industrial application. Particularly in industrial applications a learners objective is to choose (i.e., keep in  operation) all machines whose productivity is above a threshold. The TBP also finds applications in mobile communications (see \citet{audibert2010best})  where the users are to be allocated only those channels whose quality is above an acceptable threshold.
