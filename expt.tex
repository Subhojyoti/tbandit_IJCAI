	In this section we compare the empirical performance of AugUCB against APT, Uniform Allocation, CSAR, UCBE and UCBEV algorithm. The threshold $\tau$ is set at $0.5$ for all experiments. Each algorithm is run independently $500$ times for $10000$ timesteps and the output set of arms suggested by the algorithms at every timestep is recorded. The output is considered erroneous if the correct set of arms is not $i=\lbrace 6,7,8,9,10 \rbrace$ (true for all the experiments). The error percentage over $500$ runs is plotted against $10000$ timesteps. For the uniform allocation algorithm, for each $t=1,2,..,T$ the arms are sampled uniformly. For UCBE algorithm (\cite{audibert2009exploration}) which was built for single best arm identification, we modify it according to \cite{locatelli2016optimal} to suit the goal of finding arms above the threshold $\tau$. So the exploration parameter $a$ in UCBE is set to $a=\frac{T-K}{H_1}$. Again, for UCBEV, following \cite{gabillon2011multi}, we modify it such that the exploration parameter $a = \frac{T-2K}{H_{1}^{\sigma}}$. Then for each timestep $t=1,2,..,T$ we pull the arm that minimizes $\lbrace |\hat{r}_{i} -\tau|-\sqrt{\frac{a}{n_{i}}} \rbrace$, where $n_{i}$ is the number of times the arm $i$ is pulled till $t-1$ timestep and $a$ is set as mentioned above for UCBE and UCBEV respectively. Also, APT is run with $\epsilon=0.05$, which denotes the precision with which the algorithm suggests the best set of arms and we modify CSAR as per \cite{locatelli2016optimal} such that it behaves as a Successive Reject algorithm whereby it rejects the arm farthest from $\tau$ after each phase. For AugUCB we take $\rho_{\mu}=\frac{1}{8}$ and $\rho_v=\frac{1}{3}$ as in Theorem \ref{Result:Theorem:1}. In all the testbeds AugUCB, APT, CSAR, Uniform Allocation, UCBE and UCBEV are run with the same settings as mentioned above. 
%Also we run AugUCBM with arm elimination just by mean estimation and AugUCBV with arm elimination just by variance estimation. For AugUCBM, at every timestep we pull arm that minimizes $i\in\argmin_{j\in B_{m}}\bigg\lbrace |\hat{r}_{j} - \tau | - 2c_{j}\bigg\rbrace$ while for AugUCBV we pull arm that minimizes $i\in\argmin_{j\in B_{m}}\bigg\lbrace |\hat{r}_{j} - \tau | - 2s_{j}\bigg\rbrace$.

	The first experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms involving Gaussian reward distribution with expected rewards of the arms $r_{1:4}=0.2+(0:3)*0.05$, $r_{5}=0.45$, $r_{6}=0.55$, $r_{7:10}=0.65+(0:3)*0.05$ and $r_{11:100}$=0.4. The means of first $10$ arms are set as arithmetic progression. Variance is set as $\sigma_{1:5}^{2}=0.5$ and $\sigma_{6:10}^{2}=0.6$. Then $\sigma_{11:100}^{2}$ is chosen uniform randomly between $0.38-0.42$. The means in the testbed are chosen in such a way that any algorithm has to spend a significant amount of budget to explore all the arms and variance is chosen in such a way that the arms above $\tau$ have high variance whereas arms below $\tau$ have lower variance. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:budgetExpt1}. In this experiment we see that UCBEV which has access to the problem complexity and is a variance-aware algorithm beats all other algorithm including UCBE which has access to the problem complexity but does not take into account the variance of the arms. AugUCB with the said parameters outperforms UCBE, APT and the other non variance-aware algorithms that we have considered. 	
%AugUCBM with just mean estimation performs worse than AugUCB or AugUCBV, which have a matching performance in this setup.

	The second experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms with the means of first $10$ arms set as Geometric Progression. The testbed involves Gaussian reward distribution with expected rewards of the arms as $r_{1:4}=0.4-(0.2)^{1:4}$, $r_{5}=0.45$, $r_{6}=0.55$ and $r_{7:10}=0.6+(0.2)^{5-(1:4)}$. The variances of all the arms and $r_{11:100}$ are set in the same way as in experiment $1$. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:budgetExpt2}. Here, again we see that AugUCB beats APT, UCBE and all the non-variance aware algorithms with only UCBEV beating AugUCB. 
	
	The third experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms with the means of first $10$ arms set  in three groups. The testbed involves Gaussian reward distribution with expected rewards of the arms as $r_{1:3}=0.1$, $r_{4:7}=\lbrace 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65\rbrace$ and $r_{8:10}=0.9$. The variances of all the arms and $r_{11:100}$ are set in the same way as in experiment $1$. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:budgetExpt3}. Here, also we see that AugUCB beats APT, UCBE and all the non-variance aware algorithms with only UCBEV beating AugUCB. 
	
	The fourth experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms with the means of first $10$ arms set  in two groups.  The testbed involves Gaussian reward distribution with expected rewards of the arms as $r_{1:5}=0.45$ and $r_{6:10}=0.55$. The variances of all the arms and $r_{11:100}$ are set in the same way as in experiment $1$. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:budgetExpt4}. Here, also only UCBEV beats AugUCB.
	
	The fifth experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms with the means of first $10$ arms set  in two groups.  The testbed is same as the previous experiment but involves Bernoulli reward distribution with expected rewards of the arms as $r_{1:5}=0.45$ and $r_{6:10}=0.55$. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:budgetExpt5}. Here, AugUCB and APT perform almost similarly with both UCBE and UCBEV beating AugUCB.
	
	The sixth experiment is conducted on a testbed of $100$ arms involving Gaussian reward distributions with the mean of first $10$ arms set  in two groups with with expected rewards of the arms as $r_{1:5}=0.45$, $r_{6:10}=0.55$ and $r_{11:100}=0.4$. Variance is set as $\sigma_{1:5}^{2}=0.3$ and $\sigma_{6:10}^{2}=0.8$. Then $\sigma_{11:100}^{2}$ is chosen uniform randomly between $0.2-0.3$. We name this setup Advanced because in this setup the variances are set in such a way that only a variance aware algorithm will perform very well and non variance aware will perform poorly. Here UCBEV performs very well compared to others and only caught up by AugUCB. Because of such large difference in the variances between the arms below and above $\tau$, APT, UCBE and CSAR performs very badly. Also in all the experiments we see that although CSAR performs well initially, but it quickly exhausts its budget and always saturates at a higher error percentage since it has non-adaptive round length and it is pulling all arms equally in each round
